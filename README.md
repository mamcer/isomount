## Long Readme

One day I decided to review all my private repositories in bitbucket and also visualstudio online (previously known as tfspreview) collect all my POCs and side projects and publish some of them on github. 

All of them are trying to solve a particular problem. But in most cases the real reason behind, that justifies the creation and hours burnt in the project was to learn something new, test a service or just code for fun.

In this case is a front end and wrapper of Slysoft virtual clone drive. To make it easier to mount and unmount iso files in an era were this functionality wasn't built on Windows (7-)

I started this project locally back in 2010 (maybe with mercurial), later include it in visualstudio online (2013) and after that in bitbucket (2014). I have to say that the base code almost didn't change  since the first version.
